# Typescript Review

Notes -

- open-source typed syntactic superset of JavaScript, developed by Microsoft.

- Compiles to readable Javascript.

- Comes in 3 parts:
  -- Language itself
  -- Language Server - a program that feeds text editor a lot of helpful information - autocompletes, tooltips in VS Code
  -- Compiler - does type checking, compiles to JS.

- Works seamlessly with Babel 7.
